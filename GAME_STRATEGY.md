# Space Salvagers - Complete Game Strategy & Fun Design

## Core Philosophy: "Every Decision Matters"

The game is designed around extreme resource scarcity, forcing players to make tough strategic decisions. You can't build everything - you must choose wisely.

## üéØ Strategic Pillars

### 1. **Kill or Die Economy**
- **No passive income** - You only earn by destroying enemies
- **Tiny completion bonuses**:
  - Wave bonus: 10-16 salvage (almost nothing)
  - Map bonus: 70-130 salvage (barely one tower)
- **Every leaked enemy hurts twice**:
  - You lose a life
  - You lose the salvage you would have earned

### 2. **Tower Synergy System**
Players must discover powerful combinations:

#### Early Game Combos
- **Cannon + Laser**: Cannon weakens swarms, Laser finishes high-value targets
- **Double Cannon Choke**: Two cannons at a bend can handle early waves

#### Mid Game Strategies
- **Plasma Splash Zone**: Place plasma towers at path convergence points
- **Missile Coverage**: Back-line missiles provide map-wide support

#### Late Game Synergies
- **Tesla Chain Lightning**: Groups multiple enemies for area damage
- **Layered Defense**: Cannon‚ÜíPlasma‚ÜíLaser‚ÜíMissile depth

### 3. **Progressive Difficulty Curve**

Each wave within a map gets harder through:
- **Enemy Composition**: More dangerous enemies appear
- **Health Scaling**: +15% health per wave, +20% per map
- **Spawn Speed**: 10% faster per wave, 15% per map
- **Enemy Count**: Increases each wave

This creates natural difficulty spikes at:
- Wave 3 of each map (first real challenge)
- Map transitions (new enemy types)
- Map 5+ (all enemy types active)

## üéÆ Fun Mechanics & Features

### 1. **Risk/Reward Decisions**

#### Upgrade vs Expand
- Do you upgrade your cannon to level 2 (150 salvage)?
- Or build a new laser tower (140 salvage)?
- Wrong choice = game over

#### Sell & Reposition
- 80% refund means you lose 20% value
- But sometimes repositioning saves the game
- Creates "oh no!" moments when you realize tower placement is wrong

### 2. **Enemy Variety Creates Puzzles**

Each enemy type requires different strategies:

- **Scouts (Pink)**: Fast but weak - need rapid fire
- **Swarms (Cyan)**: Overwhelming numbers - need area damage
- **Fighters (Orange)**: Balanced - standard defense works
- **Bombers (Green)**: Tanky - need focused fire
- **Shields (Blue)**: Regenerating - must kill quickly
- **Stealth (Gray)**: Disappear for 1-3 seconds - need prediction
- **Destroyers (Red)**: Boss enemies - all towers focus fire

### 3. **Visual Feedback & Polish**

#### Satisfying Combat
- Enemies shake and flash when hit
- Damage numbers float up
- Death explosions with particles
- Screen shake on big kills
- Color-coded damage types

#### Tower Evolution
- Visual upgrades show power increase
- Level 3 towers look impressive
- Charging effects (laser buildup)
- Range indicators for planning

### 4. **Strategic Depth Layers**

#### Tower Placement Puzzle
- Limited build nodes force choices
- Some nodes are premium (better position)
- Path coverage vs concentrated fire

#### Timing Management
- When to start next wave (risk early for momentum)
- Upgrade timing (between waves or during?)
- Selling timing (mid-wave emergency sales)

#### Resource Management Triangle
- **Damage**: Kill enemies faster
- **Coverage**: Cover more path
- **Efficiency**: Fewer towers doing more
