ü§ñ AI Testing Strategy (Towers, Enemies, Waves)
	‚Ä¢	Goals
		‚Ä¢	Ensure enemy pathing, tower targeting, and wave orchestration are correct, deterministic, and performant
		‚Ä¢	Catch regressions in balance, behavior, and performance via automated headless runs
	‚Ä¢	Determinism & Replayability
		‚Ä¢	Single RNG service seeded per test; no use of UnityEngine.Random directly in gameplay code
		‚Ä¢	Fixed timestep for PlayMode tests; physics settings locked; disable vsync
		‚Ä¢	Record and replay: persist wave seed, spawn timestamps, and decisions to verify identical outcomes (hash of event stream)
	‚Ä¢	EditMode Unit Tests (pure logic)
		‚Ä¢	Target Selection: Given N mock enemies with distances/HP, verify selection for modes (nearest/strongest/weakest/first/last)
		‚Ä¢	Damage & Status: Verify DPS, DoT stacking caps, stun application rules (EMP vs shielded/robotic)
		‚Ä¢	Scaling: Enemy HP/speed and wave budget formulas produce expected values across waves 1‚Äì20
		‚Ä¢	Wave Budget Solver: Composition never exceeds budget; no negative counts; boss waves allocate correctly
		‚Ä¢	Economy: Refund = 80% of invested; wave-completion bonus calculation
	‚Ä¢	PlayMode/Integration Tests (headless scene)
		‚Ä¢	Pathing: Spawn batches along defined corridors; assert 100% reach core or die; zero ‚Äústuck > 3s‚Äù occurrences
		‚Ä¢	Placement/Range: Place towers on known nodes; verify range overlays and actual hit registration align within 0.1 units
		‚Ä¢	Tower vs Enemy Counters: EMP stuns shielded/robots; Gravity Well slow stacks capped; Laser deals full vs unarmored
		‚Ä¢	Wave Flow: Run waves 1‚Äì5 with scripted placements; assert station HP >= threshold and kill counts match expectations
		‚Ä¢	Save/Load: Mid-wave save disallowed; between-wave save/load restores state and deterministic next-wave outcome
	‚Ä¢	Property-Based & Fuzz
		‚Ä¢	Generate random enemy sets (within constraints) and verify invariants: no NaNs, no negative HP, no frame without progress for >2s
		‚Ä¢	Randomize tower placements within valid nodes; assert no performance spikes and no unreachable states
	‚Ä¢	Performance & Stability Gates
		‚Ä¢	Enemy Systems: With 200 active enemies, AI and pathing combined < 2.0 ms/frame on target device profile (Editor proxy < 1.0 ms)
		‚Ä¢	Tower Systems: With 50 towers, targeting + firing + VFX spawn < 2.5 ms/frame (Editor proxy < 1.5 ms)
		‚Ä¢	Memory: No growth after 5 consecutive waves (>2 minutes) beyond 10 MB; pooled projectiles/enemies reclaim on death
		‚Ä¢	Stuck Detector: Any unit not moving > 2s triggers reposition or kill-and-respawn in tests; zero occurrences allowed in CI
	‚Ä¢	Automation & CI
		‚Ä¢	Directories: Tests/EditMode for pure C#; Tests/PlayMode for scene-driven tests
		‚Ä¢	CLI: Run with Unity Test Runner in batchmode (editmode + playmode), XML results archived; coverage via Unity Code Coverage package
		‚Ä¢	Smoke Suite (fast): ~2 minutes, runs on every push; Full Suite (long): nightly includes 100-seed simulations
	‚Ä¢	Simulation Bot (rule-based)
		‚Ä¢	Script: Spend starting salvage on a prioritized build order; upgrade rules by ROI; sell low-ROI for boss prep
		‚Ä¢	Metrics: Median wave reached across 50 seeds; expected >= 10 on ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù with scripted placements
	‚Ä¢	Pass/Fail Thresholds (CI blockers)
		‚Ä¢	Determinism hash mismatch across two runs with same seed ‚Üí fail
		‚Ä¢	Any stuck unit or NaN/Infinity in transforms/HP/damage ‚Üí fail
		‚Ä¢	Performance budgets exceeded in standardized test scenes ‚Üí fail
		‚Ä¢	Wave budget or economy invariant violations ‚Üí fail
