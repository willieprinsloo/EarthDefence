ðŸŽ¨ Background Design â€“ Space Salvagers

â¸»

1. Core Concept
	â€¢	Setting: A broken orbital station floating in deep space.
	â€¢	Gameplay Area: Corridors, hull breaches, docking ports where enemies enter.
	â€¢	Style: Neon cyberpunk + derelict sci-fi â†’ dark metallic surfaces, glowing accents.
	â€¢	Layers: Should feel alive but dangerous â€” cracked metal floors, exposed wires, flickering lights.

2. Background Layers (Parallax)

Weâ€™ll use 3â€“4 parallax layers so it feels deep without distracting gameplay.

Layer 1 â€“ Space Backdrop (Farthest)
	â€¢	Starfield: Faint stars, nebula glow (deep purples, blues, magentas).
	â€¢	Occasional far-off planets or asteroids.
	â€¢	Subtle movement (slow scrolling parallax).

Layer 2 â€“ Exterior Station Hull (Behind battlefield)
	â€¢	Large structural beams, broken panels.
	â€¢	Cracks glowing with faint neon energy.
	â€¢	Floating debris drifting slowly.

Layer 3 â€“ Gameplay Zone (Corridors)
	â€¢	Walkways/corridors where enemies march.
	â€¢	Glowing outlines for tower nodes.
	â€¢	Dark metallic flooring with faint reflections.
	â€¢	Occasionally flickering warning lights or sparks.

Layer 4 â€“ Foreground FX (Optional)
	â€¢	Broken wires sparking.
	â€¢	Floating dust particles illuminated by neon lights.
	â€¢	Subtle smoke/fog in corners for atmosphere.

3. Color Palette
	â€¢	Primary: Dark greys, metallic steel.
	â€¢	Accent Glow: Neon cyan, magenta, electric purple.
	â€¢	Enemies: Alien greens/reds for contrast.
	â€¢	Highlights: White-blue energy cores, red warning lights.

4. Dynamic Elements
	â€¢	Flickering lights during boss waves.
	â€¢	Station shaking slightly when enemies hit.
	â€¢	Hull cracks glowing brighter as waves increase (tension-building).

5. Gameplay Considerations
	â€¢	Background must not distract from towers/enemies.
	â€¢	Nodes for towers should be clearly visible (bright outlines).
	â€¢	Corridors must have clear enemy paths (slightly lighter striping or markings).

6. Inspiration Board
	â€¢	Dead Space station interiors (derelict, industrial).
	â€¢	Tron Legacy neon glow (for HUD + tower accents).
	â€¢	FTL: Faster Than Light â€” flat but stylized space backdrops.
