## üéØ Strategy Tips

### Early Game
- Start with 1 cannon at a choke point
- Save for laser tower ASAP
- Focus on high-traffic areas
- Don't spread towers too thin

### Mid Game
- Upgrade existing towers before buying new ones
- Mix tower types for different enemy types
- Use plasma for groups, laser for tough enemies
- Position missiles at back for maximum coverage

### Late Game
- Level 3 towers are significantly more powerful
- Tesla towers for swarm control
- Keep some salvage for emergency towers
- Sell and reposition if needed

## üêõ Known Issues
- Restart button occasionally needs double-tap
- Missile orientation updates may lag
- Some particle effects may impact performance on older devices

## üîß Development

### Adding New Towers
1. Add tower type to `createSimpleTowerSprite()`
2. Define stats in `getTowerFireRate()` and `getTowerRange()`
3. Create projectile in `fireProjectile()`
4. Add visual in tower creation switch

### Adding New Enemies
1. Define enemy in `createEnemy()` switch
2. Add to spawn logic in `getEnemyTypeForWave()`
3. Create unique animations
4. Set health, speed, and salvage values

### Modifying Maps
1. Edit `createMapXLayout()` functions
2. Adjust path waypoints
3. Position build nodes
4. Set visual theme
